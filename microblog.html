        <p>I'm in Visakhapatnam today, to take a 2-day long workshop at IIM. I feel a little rattled about the deck that I'm using tomorrow, only because I've made a lot of changes to what it was. I hate not knowing what's going to come next as a presenter. I also lost my Garmin watch today, an event that hurt badly. That watch was a consistent part of the starkly variable last 5 years of my life. It's weird, I can't even picture myself as myself from 5 years ago. 18-year-old-me would hate the 23-year-old-me. Even the 23-year-old-me hates me. I gravely underestimated adult life. I wish I was 18 again, wearing my Garmin watch and running around on hilly trails into the sunset, chasing a new personal record. Maybe that's another thing that has escaped my life – chasing physical betterment every day. I would like to start running again.</p>

        <p>Tiring day today. A lot happened – had a fun team Christmas lunch, submitted my MIT application, cleaned my house afterwards, got rid of unused junk, packaged memories that needed preservation, cleaned my fridge, played football, packed for my 4-day long work trip tomorrow, and asked to take the next week off from work. Whew, time to get some breath back into my body. I'm looking forward to this break :)</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">13 December, 11:32 PM</p>
        <p>Had a difficult time facilitating a workshop today – it's very hard to do so with intellectuals. I like students more. This one was exhausting. It might also be fatigue, something that I feel has been accumulating for some time. Tonight, I'm switching off my computer early. I'm going to clean up and read a book in bed. Time to take a little bit of a break.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">12 December, 2:27 AM</p>
        <p>Well, here we are dear computer – you & me till the end of the world. People are just disappointments waiting to happen. I can't crack it, the code to be happy with people. Fuck people. I also finished all my graduate writing for MIT today. Sat for long hours and got it done.</p>

        <p>It feels like I'm going to puke. The application to MIT has been such a consuming journey and I've given it disproportionately more, when compared to my chances of getting in. This is going to result in a glorious, embarrassing defeat and I wonder why I made it a public affair. I could have applied and gotten rejected in secret, but now that I think about it, it would have been impossible to hide it from the people that know already. It really took over my life, I hope it gets a good look atleast. I think I have a fair chance if I get to interview with them and I desperately hope that's the case. A no-interview rejection would be tough to handle.</p>

        <p>Deep work in the first half and mindless hanging out in the second. Today, I asked two people why they liked hanging out with other people, even though most of the talking done is trivial. They said it makes them happy and 'de-stresses' them by providing a different day than usual. Strange, I would have rather spent that time alone making something or doing anything else really, but alone. Have I just become habituated to living like this or do I actually enjoy it? I don't know. I do like spending time with S though. But would I want to spend all of my hours sharing space with another person? I don't know that yet. I guess we'll figure it out when we get to it – people usually find corners of solitude where they can just be by themselves, even if they're living with another person. That's my best guess at the moment.</p>

        <p class = "alternate-p">09 December, 1:46 AM</p>
        <p>I think I work better when external deadlines are close. Wrote my final MIT statement & essay drafts today, nervous to see if reviewers find it shit. Agh, such a difficult one to crack but I'm sure I'll do it. Just wanted to get this over with. I also cleaned my house today, I feel ready for the week that is about to come. Final week before MIT applications go in. Thank god it's going to be over soon.</p>

        <p class = "alternate-p">08 December, 2:32 AM</p>
        <p>Whew. What a day. I've just managed to write down my drafts for the graduate applications at MIT. This is now my 25th draft overall. I think I realised what I did wrong the last 24 times – I dived into it, but not enough. Tonight, my living room walls are covered with post-its and there are more mind-maps around me than I remember creating. This was the missing piece, I think. I just had to dive deep. I feel happy and light.</p>
    </div><br>


    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">07 December, 1:45 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I thought about my need to make which takes over almost everyday. I've realised that it's not about creating the perfect piece, but about making tiny discoveries along the way. For example, recently, I've found a way to use WEBGL to generate outputs that seem like shader outputs but they're technically not (example here). It took me about 4 days of messing around to arrive at a concrete concept, that I can now use willingly. I think that's what I enjoy, making up new techniques to add to my visual arsenal, that I can employ when the use-case presents itself. I've also been thinking about working a little bit with data. Let's see how that turns out. I also worked out today, by the way of a small experiment that I'm running this month. Let's see how this pants out as well. Quite a lot of trying, experimenting – being in touch with the researcher that I always have been.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">06 December, 1:20 AM</p>
        <p>Spent time with S, mostly having difficult conversations. I wonder how to stop letting my past affect my future. Relationshps are difficult, risky and require courage & vulnerability. I feel weak in comparison to her.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">05 December, 12:22 AM</p>
        <p>Attended <a href = "https://www.simonandschuster.co.in/books/Inquilab-Zindabad/Ikroop-Sandhu/9789392099182">Ikroop's</a>  lecture where she talked about storytelling, using her illustrations & comic-book-writing work as examples. She answered one of my questions about her reinforcing streotypes through her work by highlighting differences between strereotypes and archetypes. Interesting zone to look into – can I use archetypes to communicate my stories better?</p>

        <p class = "alternate-p">04 December, 12:48 AM</p>
        <p>Nothing's working.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">03 December, 12:06 AM</p>
        <p>I did so much, yet I sit here with utter emptiness. My inadequacy for every little thing is consuming. It feels like I'm Laika, looking out into infinite nothingness in a man-made object progressing through space. All that changes is time and space but the feeling remains consistent, surrounding you like an unwanted embrace that you cannot hope to escape.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">02 December, 12:10 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I thought about loneliness. Somehow, people believe that loneliness is simply a matter of physical absence. It's not. It's about this journey that someone is on; or in my case, the journeys that I am on. They are so incredibly lonely – doing work that no one understands, being fascinated by things that others find mundane, feeling complexity where others perceive simplicity, surrounded by air that you've let out. It is so incredibly lonely that I wish to separate myself from this collection of wool, to be a stray thread floating around in the wind. I think I was a mistake, destroying the perfect balance that the world could have been in without my tiny presence. It's a mistake, trying to think I belong with the other threads. They're a perfect bunch, lovely to admire from afar.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">01 December, 3:32 AM</p>
        <p>For me, a big part of my journey is to be able to deal with difficult situations in healthy ways. Right now, I'm barely able to deal with them; let alone do it in ways that don't hurt other people. Decided to start graduate writing from scratch, I think I almost forgot how to mind-map. Strange, I've been out of practice with something that came so naturally to me before.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">30 November, 1:37 AM</p>
        <p>Couldn't reflect. Busy day.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">29 November, 12:37 AM</p>
        <p>Realised that my graduate application writing needed more honesty. Did something nice for someone and realised that doing nice things for other people makes me feel pleasant. Also thought about kindness today – can the world throw you thorns but you treat them with tenderness?</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">28 November, 12:43 AM</p>
        <p>Things were calm today. As I write this, I can hear the sound of the ceiling fan, the clickety-clack of the keyboard keys and the sound of silence that surrounds me. I am here, I am present and I think I needed this day amidst the storms. I wish to be calmer in my life.</p>

        <p class = "alternate-p">27 November, 12:43 AM</p>
        <p>Good end to the week, did everything that I wanted to except watch a silly movie in bed. Maybe I'll do that now, or maybe it'll carry forward to the next week.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">

        <p>Reflective day today. Realised my growth as a facilitator, what facilitation actually means, and my lack of composure in relationships. Listened to a <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/66KBRmenGEJkTKtbTWl7tS?si=a8d32049ec434245">Jagjit Singh song</a> that I used to listen to at my grandparent's house. No matter how much I deny the existence of the paternal side of my family, the truth is that I still hold on to those relationships, even without saying a single word to them. I only have 4 playlists on Spotify – one is titled "dad's" and the other, that I made today, is titled "dada-dadi ke ghar ke gaane" (the songs in my grandparent's house).</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">24 November, 12:32 AM</p>
        <p>I had a super day today. Facilitated a successful workshop at work that I didn't anticipate to be successful, finished my two writing pieces for graduate admissions, made a new recipe and cleaned the kitchen after having warm food. And it's not even 12:30! I am going to call it a day – brush, curl up with a good, easy book and speak with S. I have earned this long weekend.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">23 November, 3:01 AM</p>
        <p>If something makes me happy during the day, I am able to flow better in my work. Gloominess usually leads to forced work, which can be seen in the quality of work that comes out at the end. I need to start actively choosing happiness somehow.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">22 November, 1:43 AM</p>
        <p>Realised that honesty & authenticity are two big values that form who I am, professionally. I'm not going to morph my words, work and personality just to be accepted into a community. A lot of people in the world do that, and they will probably get to better places faster than me; but at the cost of their integrity, which is too high a price for me to pay. That's all I need to be – honest, with myself and my pursuit of graduate studies, a professional community and respect in the industry. Time to put my head down and work, without making every rejection the center of my life. Every day alive feels like an achievement.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">21 November, 1:21 AM</p>
        <p>Difficult day. Everything is crashing down. Hope is dwindling. Not feeling great.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">20 November, 1:05 AM</p>
        <p>Had fun writing a <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz4OP3eI2qn/?img_index=1">computer program to paint with the body</a>. The thought came to me while walking, but I know it is also connected to <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G0MzlfMPuM">Levin's work</a> that I saw last night. I move from ideas very quickly and right now, I'm in a space where I find myself in abundance of them. Everything seems to intrigue my wonder ... I don't think it's a bad thing. I'm easily excited and impatient. I'm still young.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">19 November, 12:51 AM</p>
        <p>Had a good day. Swam, wrote, ate good food, walked, studied and worked on my painting algorithm in the night. I've realised that two things bring me joy for sure – sports and silent walks in the night. I think I need to start surrounding myself with more things that bring me joy. Or atleast have a way to do one thing that I feel happy about at the end of the day. That is it for me, to feel happy for atleast one thing at the end of a day.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">18 November, 10:26 PM</p>
        <p>Played a lot. I like playing badminton. Did not do any work, and won't reflect as well. Goodnight.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">17 November, 1:35 AM</p>
        <p>I've realised that I probably won't be able to pursue graduate education. I'm not good enough to secure appropriate funding. The path ahead seems murky to me – I don't know what the best places are for me to apply to (for study / work), whether something good will come out of my relentless creative pursuit, and whether I'll ever be able to live out my days happily. Everything is a big-hot-mess. Ambiguity about the future makes me unstable. I will read to calm myself down.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">16 November, 1:07 AM</p>
        <p>Today, the "littlies" through the day felt celebratory. I worked, smiled, taught, napped, cooked, cleaned, and made; while all I wanted to do, since the moment I woke up, was stay in bed. Pat on the back, hug to myself and a feeble smile to call it a day. I did okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">15 November, 12:14 AM</p>
        <p>Not feeling great and, to make matters worse, I don't know what'll make me feel great. It's as if I don't know myself at all, biding away time in a stranger's body.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">14 November, 12:23 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I realised I spend a considerable amount of my income on ordering food online. Life just doesn't seem to stabilise. One after the other, problems galore. How much longer till I can choose the problems that I want to tackle? Made a <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzomP9oy_aC/">self-portrait</a> today, it feels like I'm running out of will.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">13 November, 12:39 AM</p>
        <p>I feel empty. Again, I did a lot today yet nothing seems to be of value. What is value to me? I don't know yet. Ordered and had chole bathure today, missed home.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">12 November, 12:49 AM</p>
        <p>I was a good boy today. Finished my duties as an adult, a partner, a son and a creative practitioner. I also realised that I will not survive in a loud environment. I need silence and space.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">11 November, 1:48 AM</p>
        <p>Slow day. Life feels like a lull. Made a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfPXirmMLps">film</a> to express how I'm feeling. I can't recall what makes me happy anymore. No matter how hard I try, all I feel is momentary joy. The little things feel too little, and what I seek I do not know. I can't generate appreciation. Maybe it's just a bad day , atleast I desperately hope it is.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">10 November, 1:00 AM</p>
        <p>I just 'was' today, a day came & went by. Nothing monumental achieved or lost. Felt at peace. I'm okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">09 November, 12:25 AM</p>
        <p>Emptiness fills me as I think about the passed day – I haven't done anything at all, which is absolutely untrue. I worked, made this website public, cooked, ate & cleaned. Yet, it is emptiness that I sit with. The lotus in today's mud was reading a silly paperback under sunlight. It felt peaceful, relaxing even. My graduate applications are crippled by my fear of not being good enough. At the moment, I'm just waiting for the deadline to come closer. I think that I may not be ready for a competitive graduate program.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">08 November, 1:45 AM</p>
        <p>Finished my portfolio down to the last detail. Put it up everywhere. I realised that I am the kind of person who needs to finish something and move on, otherwise it keeps interfering with other work and my attention is split. Going to start finishing all the pending stuff, quality or no quality, and moving onto other things. Been stuck on one thing (graduate applications) for too long. Time to move on.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">07 November, 2:15 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I felt restless which manifested in my 17 hour screen time. That's insane. I'm scared my laptop will get fried again, which is not a new occurrence. I've started getting allergies and migraines. Mumbai hasn't been kind to me. I wonder when I'll be able to get out of this city, this country, this life. Am I an escapist? Do I sink my feet into the sand and take the fight head on or leave in the hope of ease?</p>

        <p>The epitome of "stayed in bed and tried to rest".</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">05 November, 10:31 PM</p>
        <p>I hate being sick. Stayed in bed for most of the day, S came to take care of me, felt like a child. Missed mum a little bit. Tried working but just couldn't get myself to. Absolutely unproductive day. Hope I get better soon. Restarted my newsletter today, that counts as a small win.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">04 November, 12:26 AM</p>
        <p>Fell sick again. I don't even understand my body anymore. I'm weak, feverish and frustrated. Whenever I try to get my life back together, some absolute bullshit happens. Need to get out of Mumbai.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">03 November, 1:03 AM</p>
        <p>Went to a Diwali party with S. Too tired to reflect. Liked spending time with S.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">02 November, 2:15 AM</p>
        <p>Had difficult conversations with mum. S has been there through thick & thin, I should honour that relationship more. I haven't worked on the application this week and it's unlikely that I'll work on it over the weekend also. Surprisingly, I'm not guilty. I've bought myself time and the liberty to do it at my own pace. Need to start sleeping on time again; every time I fix it, something messes it up again. I'm okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">01 November, 1:47 AM</p>
        <p>The best part about today was holding a baby. I feel surreally connected to babies. Had a topsy-turvy day, felt socially isolated and applied for a competition in an expensive attempt to find validation. I predict there'll come a time when I'll reject or embrace external validation. At the moment, I paddle towards whatever buys me temporary peace. The fluctuation isn't healthy for the discovery of my identity. Or can it be?</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">31 October, 1:11 AM</p>
        <p>Did all my tasks today like a diligent boy. Thought about the difference it'd make if I lived or died, during lunch. Couldn't arrive at anything. Life feels meaningless if you equate it to other people. Gave up some sleep to be there for S in the night. Felt a tiny bit proud & selfless.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">30 October, 12:42 AM</p>
        <p>Had a good day until the night. Helped a person, spoke to a few people and danced in the kitchen. A conversation with P in the night destroyed the constructed happiness. I feel under-equipped, short of something – the details of which I can't figure out. Why do I feel the need to meet people's expectations?</p>
