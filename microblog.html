        <p>Today, I thought about loneliness. Somehow, people believe that loneliness is simply a matter of physical absence. It's not. It's about this journey that someone is on; or in my case, the journeys that I am on. They are so incredibly lonely – doing work that no one understands, being fascinated by things that others find mundane, feeling complexity where others perceive simplicity, surrounded by air that you've let out. It is so incredibly lonely that I wish to separate myself from this collection of wool, to be a stray thread floating around in the wind. I think I was a mistake, destroying the perfect balance that the world could have been in without my tiny presence. It's a mistake, trying to think I belong with the other threads. They're a perfect bunch, lovely to admire from afar.</p>
    </div><br>

        <p>For me, a big part of my journey is to be able to deal with difficult situations in healthy ways. Right now, I'm barely able to deal with them; let alone do it in ways that don't hurt other people. Decided to start graduate writing from scratch, I think I almost forgot how to mind-map. Strange, I've been out of practice with something that came so naturally to me before.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">30 November, 1:37 AM</p>
        <p>Couldn't reflect. Busy day.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">29 November, 12:37 AM</p>
        <p>Realised that my graduate application writing needed more honesty. Did something nice for someone and realised that doing nice things for other people makes me feel pleasant. Also thought about kindness today – can the world throw you thorns but you treat them with tenderness?</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">28 November, 12:43 AM</p>
        <p>Things were calm today. As I write this, I can hear the sound of the ceiling fan, the clickety-clack of the keyboard keys and the sound of silence that surrounds me. I am here, I am present and I think I needed this day amidst the storms. I wish to be calmer in my life.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">27 November, 12:43 AM</p>
        <p>Good end to the week, did everything that I wanted to except watch a silly movie in bed. Maybe I'll do that now, or maybe it'll carry forward to the next week.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">26 November</p>
        <p>Didn't write. Was with S.</p>

        <p>Reflective day today. Realised my growth as a facilitator, what facilitation actually means, and my lack of composure in relationships. Listened to a <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/66KBRmenGEJkTKtbTWl7tS?si=a8d32049ec434245">Jagjit Singh song</a> that I used to listen to at my grandparent's house. No matter how much I deny the existence of the paternal side of my family, the truth is that I still hold on to those relationships, even without saying a single word to them. I only have 4 playlists on Spotify – one is titled "dad's" and the other, that I made today, is titled "dada-dadi ke ghar ke gaane" (the songs in my grandparent's house).</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">24 November, 12:32 AM</p>
        <p>I had a super day today. Facilitated a successful workshop at work that I didn't anticipate to be successful, finished my two writing pieces for graduate admissions, made a new recipe and cleaned the kitchen after having warm food. And it's not even 12:30! I am going to call it a day – brush, curl up with a good, easy book and speak with S. I have earned this long weekend.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">23 November, 3:01 AM</p>
        <p>If something makes me happy during the day, I am able to flow better in my work. Gloominess usually leads to forced work, which can be seen in the quality of work that comes out at the end. I need to start actively choosing happiness somehow.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">22 November, 1:43 AM</p>
        <p>Realised that honesty & authenticity are two big values that form who I am, professionally. I'm not going to morph my words, work and personality just to be accepted into a community. A lot of people in the world do that, and they will probably get to better places faster than me; but at the cost of their integrity, which is too high a price for me to pay. That's all I need to be – honest, with myself and my pursuit of graduate studies, a professional community and respect in the industry. Time to put my head down and work, without making every rejection the center of my life. Every day alive feels like an achievement.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">21 November, 1:21 AM</p>
        <p>Difficult day. Everything is crashing down. Hope is dwindling. Not feeling great.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">20 November, 1:05 AM</p>
        <p>Had fun writing a <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz4OP3eI2qn/?img_index=1">computer program to paint with the body</a>. The thought came to me while walking, but I know it is also connected to <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G0MzlfMPuM">Levin's work</a> that I saw last night. I move from ideas very quickly and right now, I'm in a space where I find myself in abundance of them. Everything seems to intrigue my wonder ... I don't think it's a bad thing. I'm easily excited and impatient. I'm still young.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">19 November, 12:51 AM</p>
        <p>Had a good day. Swam, wrote, ate good food, walked, studied and worked on my painting algorithm in the night. I've realised that two things bring me joy for sure – sports and silent walks in the night. I think I need to start surrounding myself with more things that bring me joy. Or atleast have a way to do one thing that I feel happy about at the end of the day. That is it for me, to feel happy for atleast one thing at the end of a day.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">18 November, 10:26 PM</p>
        <p>Played a lot. I like playing badminton. Did not do any work, and won't reflect as well. Goodnight.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">17 November, 1:35 AM</p>
        <p>I've realised that I probably won't be able to pursue graduate education. I'm not good enough to secure appropriate funding. The path ahead seems murky to me – I don't know what the best places are for me to apply to (for study / work), whether something good will come out of my relentless creative pursuit, and whether I'll ever be able to live out my days happily. Everything is a big-hot-mess. Ambiguity about the future makes me unstable. I will read to calm myself down.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">16 November, 1:07 AM</p>
        <p>Today, the "littlies" through the day felt celebratory. I worked, smiled, taught, napped, cooked, cleaned, and made; while all I wanted to do, since the moment I woke up, was stay in bed. Pat on the back, hug to myself and a feeble smile to call it a day. I did okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">15 November, 12:14 AM</p>
        <p>Not feeling great and, to make matters worse, I don't know what'll make me feel great. It's as if I don't know myself at all, biding away time in a stranger's body.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">14 November, 12:23 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I realised I spend a considerable amount of my income on ordering food online. Life just doesn't seem to stabilise. One after the other, problems galore. How much longer till I can choose the problems that I want to tackle? Made a <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzomP9oy_aC/">self-portrait</a> today, it feels like I'm running out of will.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">13 November, 12:39 AM</p>
        <p>I feel empty. Again, I did a lot today yet nothing seems to be of value. What is value to me? I don't know yet. Ordered and had chole bathure today, missed home.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">12 November, 12:49 AM</p>
        <p>I was a good boy today. Finished my duties as an adult, a partner, a son and a creative practitioner. I also realised that I will not survive in a loud environment. I need silence and space.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">11 November, 1:48 AM</p>
        <p>Slow day. Life feels like a lull. Made a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfPXirmMLps">film</a> to express how I'm feeling. I can't recall what makes me happy anymore. No matter how hard I try, all I feel is momentary joy. The little things feel too little, and what I seek I do not know. I can't generate appreciation. Maybe it's just a bad day , atleast I desperately hope it is.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">10 November, 1:00 AM</p>
        <p>I just 'was' today, a day came & went by. Nothing monumental achieved or lost. Felt at peace. I'm okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">09 November, 12:25 AM</p>
        <p>Emptiness fills me as I think about the passed day – I haven't done anything at all, which is absolutely untrue. I worked, made this website public, cooked, ate & cleaned. Yet, it is emptiness that I sit with. The lotus in today's mud was reading a silly paperback under sunlight. It felt peaceful, relaxing even. My graduate applications are crippled by my fear of not being good enough. At the moment, I'm just waiting for the deadline to come closer. I think that I may not be ready for a competitive graduate program.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">08 November, 1:45 AM</p>
        <p>Finished my portfolio down to the last detail. Put it up everywhere. I realised that I am the kind of person who needs to finish something and move on, otherwise it keeps interfering with other work and my attention is split. Going to start finishing all the pending stuff, quality or no quality, and moving onto other things. Been stuck on one thing (graduate applications) for too long. Time to move on.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">07 November, 2:15 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I felt restless which manifested in my 17 hour screen time. That's insane. I'm scared my laptop will get fried again, which is not a new occurrence. I've started getting allergies and migraines. Mumbai hasn't been kind to me. I wonder when I'll be able to get out of this city, this country, this life. Am I an escapist? Do I sink my feet into the sand and take the fight head on or leave in the hope of ease?</p>

        <p>The epitome of "stayed in bed and tried to rest".</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">05 November, 10:31 PM</p>
        <p>I hate being sick. Stayed in bed for most of the day, S came to take care of me, felt like a child. Missed mum a little bit. Tried working but just couldn't get myself to. Absolutely unproductive day. Hope I get better soon. Restarted my newsletter today, that counts as a small win.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">04 November, 12:26 AM</p>
        <p>Fell sick again. I don't even understand my body anymore. I'm weak, feverish and frustrated. Whenever I try to get my life back together, some absolute bullshit happens. Need to get out of Mumbai.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">03 November, 1:03 AM</p>
        <p>Went to a Diwali party with S. Too tired to reflect. Liked spending time with S.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">02 November, 2:15 AM</p>
        <p>Had difficult conversations with mum. S has been there through thick & thin, I should honour that relationship more. I haven't worked on the application this week and it's unlikely that I'll work on it over the weekend also. Surprisingly, I'm not guilty. I've bought myself time and the liberty to do it at my own pace. Need to start sleeping on time again; every time I fix it, something messes it up again. I'm okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">01 November, 1:47 AM</p>
        <p>The best part about today was holding a baby. I feel surreally connected to babies. Had a topsy-turvy day, felt socially isolated and applied for a competition in an expensive attempt to find validation. I predict there'll come a time when I'll reject or embrace external validation. At the moment, I paddle towards whatever buys me temporary peace. The fluctuation isn't healthy for the discovery of my identity. Or can it be?</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">31 October, 1:11 AM</p>
        <p>Did all my tasks today like a diligent boy. Thought about the difference it'd make if I lived or died, during lunch. Couldn't arrive at anything. Life feels meaningless if you equate it to other people. Gave up some sleep to be there for S in the night. Felt a tiny bit proud & selfless.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">30 October, 12:42 AM</p>
        <p>Had a good day until the night. Helped a person, spoke to a few people and danced in the kitchen. A conversation with P in the night destroyed the constructed happiness. I feel under-equipped, short of something – the details of which I can't figure out. Why do I feel the need to meet people's expectations?</p>
