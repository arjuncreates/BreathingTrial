        <p>Saw a lot of conversations today on a 2-hour train ride after going to drop S. People fighting, resolving, understanding, misunderstanding, discussing, planning, joking. So much of life is spent talking to other people, exploring their experience of life. It's a rather pretty system, everyone goes an ambiguous experience that is so contrastingly different from one another that each new perspective is a version of the truth, or a permanent temporary truth.</p>

        <p>Did a lot today and wondered about how I can structure my life around learning. I've arrived at the conclusion that it has to be a mix between structured & unstructured learning, the structured bit being the one to crack. I also have to travel to Delhi in 2 days, a reality that I'm not quite comfortable with. However, I forced myself to only stay for 2 days so that I don't have time to meet a lot of people. Let's see how it goes.</p>

        <p>Sakina surprised me yesterday night by showing up at my place. Hung out with her. I like spending time with
            her. I also realised I've fallen in love with someone – never before have I ever thought of spending all my
            free time with a single person.</p>

        <p>Wondered about dispassionate people – how do people go about their lives without ever being consumed in the
            pursuit of something? I figure that they must be passionate about some thing, just not academic things.
            Then, in that case, why do people admit themselves to institutes devoted to learning? Strange, the people
            who crave learning are outside of school while the ones inside are bored of learning.</p>

        <p>Been facilitating workshops over the last 3 days, tomorrow's the last one. I've finally figured out a way for
            reluctant students to put down wacky ideas on paper – use authority to give them a task of achieving a near
            impossible number of ideas using a method that displays freeness (mind-mapping), in an "amused" state. It
            has worked well for me once, and I'm excited to try it again, this time with a group of even more reluctant
            students. I also heard my coworkers state that I'm unbelievably consistent with my personal creative work
            and I had no reason for them – I simply said, I can't sleep otherwise. I feel like a manifestation of
            Charles Bukowski's poem, <a href="https://poets.org/poem/so-you-want-be-writer">"So You Want To Be A
                Writer?"</a>. Lastly, I've understood that I hate a lot of masala in my food and I like the bland-er
            food I make at home.</p>

        <p>In Indore for work today. Been collaborating with Shobhan virtually a lot recently, and he has pushed me to
            think differently about my "code as a creative medium" course. I have enough work lined up for all of
            January. I also have a sick tummy which I hope will get better by tomorrow, otherwise I anticipate a hard
            time, trying to facilitate full-day workshops. Also started reading <em>Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a
                Philosophy of the Future</em> by Friedrich Nietzsche. Made me wonder about egoistic, convinced men.</p>

        <p>The world has clarity on how they wish this year to go. I feebly have questions, hypotheses, experiments and
            a mess of words that demand synthetic ability that I do not possess at the moment. <a

        <p>Woohoo! Finished all the work I had planned for the weekend. No new thoughts particularly; I'm struggling
            with a lot of mosquitos in my house. Need to find a good way to keep them out. Also watched "Kho Gaye Hum
            Kahan" – no strong opinions, just an "eh" film. It was well shot but the storyline lacked grip. The end was
            also a little preachy in my opinion.</p>

        <p>I find myself with a mountain of work to complete over the weekend. The goal is to tactfully get most of it
            done tomorrow, whilst having a little bit of time to unwind and relax. Will this be possible? I don't know.
            Work is starting to seem like an unwanted burden but what else am I supposed to do, I desperately need my
            job. I can only hope to strike a better balance, to not let it consume my creative aspirations.</p>

        <p>I feel a little low today and it's not a single reason, but an array of them. I've realised that sleeping for
            longer helps and I plan to get in a run tomorrow morning to kick-start my day. I also read up a little bit
            on livecoding and I'm interested in the possibilities that could arise by using algorithms to generate music
            & visuals. Maybe a possible learning endeavour for 2024.</p>

        <p>Very thoughtful day. I wondered about why I clash with strong personalities – something that has been on my
            mind for a while now. I have two hypotheses – one being that I lack conviction in my own points. Maybe my
            base isn't strong enough; but that can't be true because I mentor and guide well enough. And I'm not poorly
            read. The next possible reason is because I'm afraid of defeat, my point versus your point and I lose, you
            win. Is that it? I haven't figured this interaction out yet – how do I put forth my thoughts amongst people
            with strong thoughts who aren't willing to budge? I also feel creatively suffocated but I have no way out
            yet. I hope I get to be in a more creative, liberal and experimentative space soon. Trying to get sleep &
            exercise back into my life, let's see how long that lasts.</p>

        <p>It was Christmas today. I listened to an Andy Williams <a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5hslUAKq9I9CG2bAulFkHN?si=32472347dff94c61">song</a>, worked, made
            pasta and watched a Hugh Grant <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109831/">movie</a>; all before 11PM.
            I'm hoping to add a little bit of slowness to my life, living the moments I otherwise frivolously spend.
            Today is a day where I find myself peacefully smiling, comforted by warmth even amidst the horrible Bombay
            weather. I also got to know about someone who lost their job today in a company-wide layoff. It forces me to
            re-count my blessings, and to be more accountable with what I have. </p>

        <p>I'm in Visakhapatnam today, to take a 2-day long workshop at IIM. I feel a little rattled about the deck that
            I'm using tomorrow, only because I've made a lot of changes to what it was. I hate not knowing what's going
            to come next as a presenter. I also lost my Garmin watch today, an event that hurt badly. That watch was a
            consistent part of the starkly variable last 5 years of my life. It's weird, I can't even picture myself as
            myself from 5 years ago. 18-year-old-me would hate the 23-year-old-me. Even the 23-year-old-me hates me. I
            gravely underestimated adult life. I wish I was 18 again, wearing my Garmin watch and running around on
            hilly trails into the sunset, chasing a new personal record. Maybe that's another thing that has escaped my
            life – chasing physical betterment every day. I would like to start running again.</p>

        <p>Tiring day today. A lot happened – had a fun team Christmas lunch, submitted my MIT application, cleaned my
            house afterwards, got rid of unused junk, packaged memories that needed preservation, cleaned my fridge,
            played football, packed for my 4-day long work trip tomorrow, and asked to take the next week off from work.
            Whew, time to get some breath back into my body. I'm looking forward to this break :)</p>

    <div class="body-container">

        <p>Had a difficult time facilitating a workshop today – it's very hard to do so with intellectuals. I like
            students more. This one was exhausting. It might also be fatigue, something that I feel has been
            accumulating for some time. Tonight, I'm switching off my computer early. I'm going to clean up and read a
            book in bed. Time to take a little bit of a break.</p>

        <p>Well, here we are dear computer – you & me till the end of the world. People are just disappointments waiting
            to happen. I can't crack it, the code to be happy with people. Fuck people. I also finished all my graduate
            writing for MIT today. Sat for long hours and got it done.</p>

        <p>It feels like I'm going to puke. The application to MIT has been such a consuming journey and I've given it
            disproportionately more, when compared to my chances of getting in. This is going to result in a glorious,
            embarrassing defeat and I wonder why I made it a public affair. I could have applied and gotten rejected in
            secret, but now that I think about it, it would have been impossible to hide it from the people that know
            already. It really took over my life, I hope it gets a good look atleast. I think I have a fair chance if I
            get to interview with them and I desperately hope that's the case. A no-interview rejection would be tough
            to handle.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">10 December, 12:35 AM</p>
        <p>Deep work in the first half and mindless hanging out in the second. Today, I asked two people why they liked
            hanging out with other people, even though most of the talking done is trivial. They said it makes them
            happy and 'de-stresses' them by providing a different day than usual. Strange, I would have rather spent
            that time alone making something or doing anything else really, but alone. Have I just become habituated to
            living like this or do I actually enjoy it? I don't know. I do like spending time with S though. But would I
            want to spend all of my hours sharing space with another person? I don't know that yet. I guess we'll figure
            it out when we get to it – people usually find corners of solitude where they can just be by themselves,
            even if they're living with another person. That's my best guess at the moment.</p>

        <p>I think I work better when external deadlines are close. Wrote my final MIT statement & essay drafts today,
            nervous to see if reviewers find it shit. Agh, such a difficult one to crack but I'm sure I'll do it. Just
            wanted to get this over with. I also cleaned my house today, I feel ready for the week that is about to
            come. Final week before MIT applications go in. Thank god it's going to be over soon.</p>

        <p>Whew. What a day. I've just managed to write down my drafts for the graduate applications at MIT. This is now
            my 25th draft overall. I think I realised what I did wrong the last 24 times – I dived into it, but not
            enough. Tonight, my living room walls are covered with post-its and there are more mind-maps around me than
            I remember creating. This was the missing piece, I think. I just had to dive deep. I feel happy and light.

        <p class="alternate-p">07 December, 1:45 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I thought about my need to make which takes over almost everyday. I've realised that it's not about
            creating the perfect piece, but about making tiny discoveries along the way. For example, recently, I've
            found a way to use WEBGL to generate outputs that seem like shader outputs but they're technically not
            (example here). It took me about 4 days of messing around to arrive at a concrete concept, that I can now
            use willingly. I think that's what I enjoy, making up new techniques to add to my visual arsenal, that I can
            employ when the use-case presents itself. I've also been thinking about working a little bit with data.
            Let's see how that turns out. I also worked out today, by the way of a small experiment that I'm running
            this month. Let's see how this pants out as well. Quite a lot of trying, experimenting – being in touch with
            the researcher that I always have been.</p>

            She answered one of my questions about her reinforcing streotypes through her work by highlighting

        <p>Today, I thought about loneliness. Somehow, people believe that loneliness is simply a matter of physical
            absence. It's not. It's about this journey that someone is on; or in my case, the journeys that I am on.
            They are so incredibly lonely – doing work that no one understands, being fascinated by things that others
            find mundane, feeling complexity where others perceive simplicity, surrounded by air that you've let out. It
            is so incredibly lonely that I wish to separate myself from this collection of wool, to be a stray thread
            floating around in the wind. I think I was a mistake, destroying the perfect balance that the world could
            have been in without my tiny presence. It's a mistake, trying to think I belong with the other threads.
            They're a perfect bunch, lovely to admire from afar.</p>

        <p>For me, a big part of my journey is to be able to deal with difficult situations in healthy ways. Right now,
            I'm barely able to deal with them; let alone do it in ways that don't hurt other people. Decided to start
            graduate writing from scratch, I think I almost forgot how to mind-map. Strange, I've been out of practice
            with something that came so naturally to me before.</p>

        <p>Things were calm today. As I write this, I can hear the sound of the ceiling fan, the clickety-clack of the
            keyboard keys and the sound of silence that surrounds me. I am here, I am present and I think I needed this
            day amidst the storms. I wish to be calmer in my life.</p>

        <p>Good end to the week, did everything that I wanted to except watch a silly movie in bed. Maybe I'll do that
            now, or maybe it'll carry forward to the next week.</p>

        <p>Reflective day today. Realised my growth as a facilitator, what facilitation actually means, and my lack of
            composure in relationships. Listened to a <a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/track/66KBRmenGEJkTKtbTWl7tS?si=a8d32049ec434245">Jagjit Singh song</a>
            that I used to listen to at my grandparent's house. No matter how much I deny the existence of the paternal
            side of my family, the truth is that I still hold on to those relationships, even without saying a single
            word to them. I only have 4 playlists on Spotify – one is titled "dad's" and the other, that I made today,
            is titled "dada-dadi ke ghar ke gaane" (the songs in my grandparent's house).</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">24 November, 12:32 AM</p>
        <p>I had a super day today. Facilitated a successful workshop at work that I didn't anticipate to be successful,
            finished my two writing pieces for graduate admissions, made a new recipe and cleaned the kitchen after
            having warm food. And it's not even 12:30! I am going to call it a day – brush, curl up with a good, easy
            book and speak with S. I have earned this long weekend.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">23 November, 3:01 AM</p>
        <p>If something makes me happy during the day, I am able to flow better in my work. Gloominess usually leads to
            forced work, which can be seen in the quality of work that comes out at the end. I need to start actively
            choosing happiness somehow.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">22 November, 1:43 AM</p>
        <p>Realised that honesty & authenticity are two big values that form who I am, professionally. I'm not going to
            morph my words, work and personality just to be accepted into a community. A lot of people in the world do
            that, and they will probably get to better places faster than me; but at the cost of their integrity, which
            is too high a price for me to pay. That's all I need to be – honest, with myself and my pursuit of graduate
            studies, a professional community and respect in the industry. Time to put my head down and work, without
            making every rejection the center of my life. Every day alive feels like an achievement.</p>

        <p>Difficult day. Everything is crashing down. Hope is dwindling. Not feeling great.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">20 November, 1:05 AM</p>
        <p>Had fun writing a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz4OP3eI2qn/?img_index=1">computer program to paint
                with the body</a>. The thought came to me while walking, but I know it is also connected to <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G0MzlfMPuM">Levin's work</a> that I saw last night. I move from
            ideas very quickly and right now, I'm in a space where I find myself in abundance of them. Everything seems
            to intrigue my wonder ... I don't think it's a bad thing. I'm easily excited and impatient. I'm still young.

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">19 November, 12:51 AM</p>
        <p>Had a good day. Swam, wrote, ate good food, walked, studied and worked on my painting algorithm in the night.
            I've realised that two things bring me joy for sure – sports and silent walks in the night. I think I need
            to start surrounding myself with more things that bring me joy. Or atleast have a way to do one thing that I
            feel happy about at the end of the day. That is it for me, to feel happy for atleast one thing at the end of
            a day.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">18 November, 10:26 PM</p>
        <p>Played a lot. I like playing badminton. Did not do any work, and won't reflect as well. Goodnight.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">17 November, 1:35 AM</p>
        <p>I've realised that I probably won't be able to pursue graduate education. I'm not good enough to secure
            appropriate funding. The path ahead seems murky to me – I don't know what the best places are for me to
            apply to (for study / work), whether something good will come out of my relentless creative pursuit, and
            whether I'll ever be able to live out my days happily. Everything is a big-hot-mess. Ambiguity about the
            future makes me unstable. I will read to calm myself down.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">16 November, 1:07 AM</p>
        <p>Today, the "littlies" through the day felt celebratory. I worked, smiled, taught, napped, cooked, cleaned,
            and made; while all I wanted to do, since the moment I woke up, was stay in bed. Pat on the back, hug to
            myself and a feeble smile to call it a day. I did okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">15 November, 12:14 AM</p>
        <p>Not feeling great and, to make matters worse, I don't know what'll make me feel great. It's as if I don't
            know myself at all, biding away time in a stranger's body.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">14 November, 12:23 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I realised I spend a considerable amount of my income on ordering food online. Life just doesn't seem
            to stabilise. One after the other, problems galore. How much longer till I can choose the problems that I
            want to tackle? Made a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzomP9oy_aC/">self-portrait</a> today, it feels
            like I'm running out of will.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">13 November, 12:39 AM</p>
        <p>I feel empty. Again, I did a lot today yet nothing seems to be of value. What is value to me? I don't know
            yet. Ordered and had chole bathure today, missed home.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">12 November, 12:49 AM</p>
        <p>I was a good boy today. Finished my duties as an adult, a partner, a son and a creative practitioner. I also
            realised that I will not survive in a loud environment. I need silence and space.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">11 November, 1:48 AM</p>
        <p>Slow day. Life feels like a lull. Made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfPXirmMLps">film</a> to
            express how I'm feeling. I can't recall what makes me happy anymore. No matter how hard I try, all I feel is
            momentary joy. The little things feel too little, and what I seek I do not know. I can't generate
            appreciation. Maybe it's just a bad day , atleast I desperately hope it is.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">10 November, 1:00 AM</p>
        <p>I just 'was' today, a day came & went by. Nothing monumental achieved or lost. Felt at peace. I'm okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">09 November, 12:25 AM</p>
        <p>Emptiness fills me as I think about the passed day – I haven't done anything at all, which is absolutely
            untrue. I worked, made this website public, cooked, ate & cleaned. Yet, it is emptiness that I sit with. The
            lotus in today's mud was reading a silly paperback under sunlight. It felt peaceful, relaxing even. My
            graduate applications are crippled by my fear of not being good enough. At the moment, I'm just waiting for
            the deadline to come closer. I think that I may not be ready for a competitive graduate program.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">08 November, 1:45 AM</p>
        <p>Finished my portfolio down to the last detail. Put it up everywhere. I realised that I am the kind of person
            who needs to finish something and move on, otherwise it keeps interfering with other work and my attention
            is split. Going to start finishing all the pending stuff, quality or no quality, and moving onto other
            things. Been stuck on one thing (graduate applications) for too long. Time to move on.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">07 November, 2:15 AM</p>
        <p>Today, I felt restless which manifested in my 17 hour screen time. That's insane. I'm scared my laptop will
            get fried again, which is not a new occurrence. I've started getting allergies and migraines. Mumbai hasn't
            been kind to me. I wonder when I'll be able to get out of this city, this country, this life. Am I an
            escapist? Do I sink my feet into the sand and take the fight head on or leave in the hope of ease?</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">

        <p>The epitome of "stayed in bed and tried to rest".</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">05 November, 10:31 PM</p>
        <p>I hate being sick. Stayed in bed for most of the day, S came to take care of me, felt like a child. Missed
            mum a little bit. Tried working but just couldn't get myself to. Absolutely unproductive day. Hope I get
            better soon. Restarted my newsletter today, that counts as a small win.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">04 November, 12:26 AM</p>
        <p>Fell sick again. I don't even understand my body anymore. I'm weak, feverish and frustrated. Whenever I try
            to get my life back together, some absolute bullshit happens. Need to get out of Mumbai.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">03 November, 1:03 AM</p>
        <p>Went to a Diwali party with S. Too tired to reflect. Liked spending time with S.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">02 November, 2:15 AM</p>
        <p>Had difficult conversations with mum. S has been there through thick & thin, I should honour that
            relationship more. I haven't worked on the application this week and it's unlikely that I'll work on it over
            the weekend also. Surprisingly, I'm not guilty. I've bought myself time and the liberty to do it at my own
            pace. Need to start sleeping on time again; every time I fix it, something messes it up again. I'm okay.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">01 November, 1:47 AM</p>
        <p>The best part about today was holding a baby. I feel surreally connected to babies. Had a topsy-turvy day,
            felt socially isolated and applied for a competition in an expensive attempt to find validation. I predict
            there'll come a time when I'll reject or embrace external validation. At the moment, I paddle towards
            whatever buys me temporary peace. The fluctuation isn't healthy for the discovery of my identity. Or can it
            be?</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">31 October, 1:11 AM</p>
        <p>Did all my tasks today like a diligent boy. Thought about the difference it'd make if I lived or died, during
            lunch. Couldn't arrive at anything. Life feels meaningless if you equate it to other people. Gave up some
            sleep to be there for S in the night. Felt a tiny bit proud & selfless.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class="alternate-p">30 October, 12:42 AM</p>
        <p>Had a good day until the night. Helped a person, spoke to a few people and danced in the kitchen. A
            conversation with P in the night destroyed the constructed happiness. I feel under-equipped, short of
            something – the details of which I can't figure out. Why do I feel the need to meet people's expectations?
