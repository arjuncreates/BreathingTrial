        <p>Went to a Diwali party with S. Too tired to reflect. Liked spending time with S.</p>

        <p>Had difficult conversations with mum. S has been there through thick & thin, I should honour that relationship more. I haven't worked on the application this week and it's unlikely that I'll work on it over the weekend also. Surprisingly, I'm not guilty. I've bought myself time and the liberty to do it at my own pace. Need to start sleeping on time again; every time I fix it, something messes it up again. I'm okay.</p>

        <p>The best part about today was holding a baby. I feel surreally connected to babies. Had a topsy-turvy day, felt socially isolated and applied for a competition in an expensive attempt to find validation. I predict there'll come a time when I'll reject or embrace external validation. At the moment, I paddle towards whatever buys me temporary peace. The fluctuation isn't healthy for the discovery of my identity. Or can it be?</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">31 October, 1:11 AM</p>
        <p>Did all my tasks today like a diligent boy. Thought about the difference it'd make if I lived or died, during lunch. Couldn't arrive at anything. Life feels meaningless if you equate it to other people. Gave up some sleep to be there for S in the night. Felt a tiny bit proud & selfless.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p class = "alternate-p">30 October, 12:42 AM</p>
        <p>Had a good day until the night. Helped a person, spoke to a few people and danced in the kitchen. A conversation with P in the night destroyed the constructed happiness. I feel under-equipped, short of something â€“ the details of which I can't figure out. Why do I feel the need to meet people's expectations?</p>
