        <p>Did all my tasks today like a diligent boy. Thought about the difference it'd make if I lived or died, during lunch. Couldn't arrive at anything. Life feels meaningless if you equate it to other people. Gave up some sleep to be there for S in the night. Felt a tiny bit proud & selfless.</p>

        <p>Had a good day until the night. Helped a person, spoke to a few people and danced in the kitchen. A conversation with P in the night destroyed the constructed happiness. I feel under-equipped, short of something â€“ the details of which I can't figure out. Why do I feel the need to meet people's expectations?</p>
