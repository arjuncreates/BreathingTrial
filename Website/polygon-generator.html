    <h2>Thought</h2>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>During my time at NCBS as part of the <a href = "https://bengaluru.sciencegallery.com/xperimenter-programme">Xperimenters programme</a> at Science Gallery Bengaluru</a>, I wandered around the campus a lot. Being around _smart_ people has always fascinated me, for I like to find my own tiny meaning in their gargantuan complexity. What struck me one day was a whiteboard outside the main academic building, possibly something that the professors used to explain concepts outdoors.</p>

<div class="img-container">
    <img src = "/caseStudyImages/PolygonGenerator/Whiteboard.JPG.webp" alt="A picture of a whiteboard with diagonal lines joining dots on the circumference of a circle" width="500px">
</div>

<div class="body-container">
    <p>The whiteboard presented an interesting visual of a shape being formed by joining dots on the circumference of a circle. I have no idea about the meaning of this shape or the complex jargon that surrounded it. The idea, however, of lines originating from a point to join all the other points was visually interesting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I wondered what kind of shapes could be generated by a computer that could move around interconnected dots. Wrote a program on p5.js to simulate just that.</p>
