    <h2>Thought</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>During an academic project in my third year at IIAD, <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shyam-attreya-aa077950?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAArKzdgBHyRlWAivvKMnjBxMzLIPOADKr-A&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3B1PV4dYQqQZuNYVFi5pwtrA%3D%3D"> Shyam Attreya</a> discussed how metropolitan cities in India such as New Delhi witness long queues at places like hospitals & airports. This is primarily because certain processes, for example checking in at an airport, are conducted by a limited number of personnel for a crowd much larger than what they can efficiently handle.</p>

<div class="body-container">
    <p>A similar case that I observed was at Max Hospital, Delhi. Upon entering the OPD, people would rush to the reception desk in panic to ask questions that resulted in repetitive answers by the hospital staff.<br><br>
        I wondered whether these repetitive communication patterns could possibly be automated to increase efficiency. For example, during COVID-19, healthcare workers asked questions with binary answer possibilities to ascertain whether the individual is safe or at risk.</p>

    <p>It struck me that processes such as the one above, that attempt to get user-response to close-ended questions, could be processed much faster with a simple digital intervention.</p>

    <h2>Deciding The Ideal Interface</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>In order to maximise efficiency with minimal contact, I decided to break away from the traditional desktop paradigm (of a display interacted via a keyboard & mouse). A visual interface that could be interacted via gestural inputs seemed to be quite desirable.</p><br><br>
        <p>At the time, I had no knowledge of creating a gesture recognition program. However, I had been exploring the capabilities of the webcam on my personal computer by making tiny experiments on Processing.</p>

</div>
<br>
<div class="body-container">
    <p>It struck me that for an interface that needs input for binary answer possibilities, I don’t necessarily require a gesture recognition program. A simple interface that allows a person to communicate their choice between Option A & Option B is enough. To achieve this, I decided to use the head as a replacement for the mouse, with answer possibilities placed on either side of the screen. A simple head tilt was enough to input the desired answer.</p>
