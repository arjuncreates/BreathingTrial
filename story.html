                Hi, this is the story of how I became the boy above.<br><br>
                I had a fairly unstable childhood, moving with / between my parents to different parts of India and studying in as many as 7 different schools. My parents loved being on the road and, for 15 years of my life, I found myself in the backseat of their car far too often.

                Out of all 5 senses, I believe that I have experienced the world the most visually. Whether it was peering out the backseat window of a car, staring at people from afar, or searching for a visually striking detail to recall something later, the world has always made more sense to me when I’ve observed it from the outside, rather than experiencing it from the inside. Patterns, images, shapes, forms and colors that emerge have always fascinated me; although my own talent in creating them remains questionable.<br><br>
                Until I was 18, most of my time went in sports: football, athletics, mountaineering, rock & sport climbing. Madly, I pursued a futile dream of becoming a professional athlete, and failed over & over again.

                What did work out for me, eventually, was design. I landed up at the Indian Institute of Art & Design in 2018, wanting to become a proficient graphic designer. My naivety soon broke, as I explored the expansive world of design for 4 years, finally finding a long-lost sense of belonging in the discipline.

                It quickly became evident to me that whoever I was fit well with what was expected in a designer. I could thrive in all the environments that I was pushed into, irrespective of their scale. Design came to me; steps of the process felt natural, transitions between creative & critical thinking became fluid and my incessant curiosity could finally embrace an open playground.<br><br>
                Towards the end of my 4 years at IIAD, I fell in love with the relationship between humans and computers: fast, accurate, rational machines working in symbiosis with slow, inaccurate, irrational human beings to achieve collective output.<br><br>
                Most of my <a href = "work.html">work</a>, till now, has focused on exploring this relationship in different capacities.
