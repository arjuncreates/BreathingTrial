    <div class="body-container">
        <p>Every final semester student at the Indian Institute of Art & Design is expected to undertake an
            independently driven 16 week long graduation project. This is meant to conclude their 4-year program, by
            resulting in a substantial response to an individually defined design issue of interest.</p>
        <p>During my final semester at IIAD, I was selected by Science Gallery Bengaluru to be a part of their maiden
            Xperimenters cohort: a 6-month long programme to offer interdisciplinary mentorship for 4 young adults to
            drive public engagement projects at the gallery.</p>

        <p>One of the main projects for each Xperimenter was to independently conceptualise, plan and execute a public
            engagement programme for PSYCHE: an online exhibition that explored the human mind. This became my design
            brief for the graduation project as well.</p>
        <p>By carefully merging the professional requirements of creating a public engagement programme & following a
            human-centred project philosophy, I developed In Between Life & Death: a web-based game that converted A.H
            Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs into playable levels. A player wakes up as a digital particle and attempts
            to progress through the hierarchies by fulfilling the requirements of each. The varied experiences of young
            adults around the country who played the game were later critically discussed in Breaking Down The Making:
            an online workshop where participants questioned my interpretation of the theory, human needs, happiness and
            the existence (or inexistence) of a grand life purpose.</p>
