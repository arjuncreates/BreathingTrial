        <p>By the time I graduated in 2022, I understood that there was a need for me to document & archive my work. I had three reasons: (a) to easily share work with people, (b) to have a digital archive of my journey, and (c) to better understand my process by writing about it.</p>

        <p>Throughout 2022-2023, I read religiously for ~30 minutes everyday. This could include papers, books, blogs, articles and pretty much anything that tickled my fancy. By doing this, I came across several personal websites that acted as inspiration for my own. Here are all the websites that (I think) influenced my design of this portfolio:</p>

    <div class = "pointer-container">
            <p><strong><a href = "https://gwern.net/">Gwern.net</a></strong><br>
                - Effective usage of typography<br>
                - Creative confidence of not shying away from one’s personal style <br>
                - Personality coming through: if you write long-form articles, why keep your website content short (which is what we are taught in most design schools)<br>
                - Forced me to question who I was and wanted to be on the internet<br> 
            </p><br>
            <p><strong><a href = "https://alex.miller.garden/">Alex Miller’s Personal Website</a></strong><br>
                - Clean, simple layout
                - Colour scheme
                - Used his idea of project tags on my own website                
            </p><br>
            <p><strong>No Intimation About Errors</strong><br>
            People who tried onboarding for the first time often felt stuck at certain parts of the journey, as they may have performed a wrong action very early on in the process, that they were never notified of. This led to them not being able to progress to the next step as their input was not what the onboarding algorithm expected (as shown below).
