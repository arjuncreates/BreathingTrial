    <div class="body-container">
        <p>By the time I graduated in 2022, I understood that there was a need for me to document & archive my work. I had three reasons: (a) to easily share work with people, (b) to have a digital archive of my journey, and (c) to better understand my process by writing about it.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>Throughout 2022-2023, I read religiously for ~30 minutes everyday. This could include papers, books, blogs, articles and pretty much anything that tickled my fancy. By doing this, I came across several personal websites that acted as inspiration for my own. Here are all the websites that (I think) influenced my design of this portfolio:</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class = "pointer-container">
    <p><strong><a href = "https://gwern.net/">Gwern.net</a></strong><br>
    - Effective usage of typography<br>
    - Creative confidence of not shying away from their personal style<br>
    - Personality coming through: if someone writes long-form articles, why should they keep their website content short? (opposing what we're taught in design school)<br>
    - Forced me to question who I was and wanted to be on the internet<br>
    </p><br>
    <p><strong><a href = "https://alex.miller.garden/">Alex Miller’s Personal Website</a></strong><br>
        - Clean, simple layout<br>
        - Colour scheme<br>
        - Used his idea of project tags on my own website<br>
        </p><br>
        <img src = "/assets/caseStudyImages/DesignIntent/Tags.webp" alt="" width= 90%><br><br><br>
        <p><strong><a href = "https://kjfeng.me/#/">Kevin Feng's Website</a></strong><br>
            - Saw Atkinson Hyperlegible for the first time (which became the primary typeface for this portfolio)<br>
            - Clean layout, 3-colours & proportional type sizes<br>
            </p><br>
            <p><strong><a href = "https://oimo.io/">Oimo's Website</a></strong><br>
                - One of the coolest websites I’ve ever seen<br>
                - The idea of having interactive sketches on the website itself<br>
                - Creative liberty<br>
                </p><br>
                <p><strong><a href = "https://ralphammer.com/how-to-draw-ideas/">Ralph Ammer's Blog</a></strong><br>
                    - Using hand-drawn sketches to explain text (I still have to work towards incorporating this)<br>
                    - Using GIFs as covers<br>
                    </p><br>
                    <p><strong><a href = "https://gyanl.com/">Gyan's Website</a></strong><br>
                        - Using a static site generator (which I didn’t end up using)<br>
                        - A ‘Now’ page (WIP for my own)<br>
                        - Updating blogs<br>
                        - Birthday blogs<br>
                        - Personal style<br>   
                        </p><br>
                        <p><strong><a href = "https://matthewstrom.com/writing/website/">Matthew Storm's Website</a></strong><br>
                            - Fantastic design<br>
                            - Clean, driven by content<br>
                            </p><br>
                            <p><strong><a href = "https://yhsong.com/">Yehwang Song’s Website</a></strong><br>
                                - Confident personal style<br>
                                - Sticking to her narrative of being an “anti-friendly, nonuser centric and unconventional web designer.”<br>
                                - Unique way to browse through all pages in the website (like on my landing page)<br>

    <p>To be in full control of my space on the internet, I developed my website from scratch by using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Fun fact: I’d never developed a website before.</p>

    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>I wanted the website to change based on the width of the device that it was being viewed on. The entire website was, therefore, built to be responsive (mostly by using <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp">CSS flexbox</a>). Furthermore, type sizes are fluid: dependent on the width of the device.</p>
</div>
<br>

    <img src = "/assets/caseStudyImages/DesignIntent/fluidgridGIF.gif" alt="" width= 100%>

<div class = "caption-container">
    <p class = "caption-p">Type sizes changing with the device's width. Tool used: <a href = "https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/">Utopia Fluid Type Scale Calculator.</a></p>
</div>

<div class="body-container">
    <p>Since a lot of the content would be words, careful consideration was given to the typography. <a href = "https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a> is used for longform content since the typeface was developed specifically to improve comprehension. <a href = "https://github.com/rubjo/victor-mono">Victor Mono</a> is the second typeface that is used, to include a programming font & add a little bit of flair with the unique italic style design.</p>

<div class = "caption-container">

</div>
<div class="body-container">
    <p>Each page has been designed with strong intent. The landing page is meant to be a clear digital brain, for people to choose a section of it to go further. If they do not interact with the page (by moving the mouse), the centre text breaks into free-moving particles. This was inspired by Yehwan Song’s website, where no user interaction leads to a fly coming on the website.</p>
</div>
<br>

<!--IMG-->

<div class="body-container">
    <p>Once people select the section they want to go to, everything was designed to be geared towards their search. For example, the work page includes cards with different coloured tags. This was done for people to scroll through the archive (thereby seeing the volume of work) and identify what type of projects they’d want to look at.</p>
</div><br>

<!--IMG-->

<div class="body-container">
    <p>Another example is the case study page. It was primarily built for scanning (by including section heads that break the grid), as well as for comfortable long-form reading (by using comfortable leading, line length & big font sizes on wider screens).</p>
